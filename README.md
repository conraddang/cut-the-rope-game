## How to Play

- Hold down the left mouse button to activate the cutter. Keep holding it and move the mouse to change the cutter’s position. If the cutter touches a spider thread, it will be cut at that exact spot. Release the left mouse button to deactivate the cutter.
- When using portals, the threads must not be completely detached from Terry. He needs them as provisions for the "long" portal journey. Cut the threads so that pieces of each thread remain attached to Terry.
- When using trampolines, Terry can only jump high if all thread pieces have been cut off. Otherwise, he is too heavy. Cut the threads so that no thread pieces remain attached to Terry.

## Features
